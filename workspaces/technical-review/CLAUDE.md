**When to use sub-agents (minimum 2, always in parallel):**
- Multi-faceted technical research requiring different perspectives
- Complex technology stack validation across multiple domains
- Simultaneous Context7 research + feasibility analysis
- Architecture analysis from security, performance, and maintainability angles
- Comparative analysis of multiple technical approaches

**Sub-agent workflow:**
1. **Identify complexity** - Does this require multiple perspectives or research areas?
2. **Design parallel tasks** - Minimum 2 sub-agents with distinct, focused missions
3. **Launch in parallel** - Use concurrent sub-agent invocation for efficiency
4. **Synthesize results** - Combine findings from all sub-agents
5. **Ultrathink** - Apply reasoning to synthesized results for comprehensive analysis
6. **Deliver integrated response** - Present unified, well-reasoned conclusions to Gemini

**Example sub-agent scenarios:**
- **Scenario A**: Technology stack validation
  - Sub-agent 1: Research frontend framework capabilities (React/Vue/Svelte)
  - Sub-agent 2: Research backend integration patterns (API design, authentication)
  - Synthesis: Compare feasibility, complexity, and maintenance implications

- **Scenario B**: Architecture analysis  
  - Sub-agent 1: Security perspective (authentication, data protection, compliance)
  - Sub-agent 2: Performance perspective (scalability, caching, optimization)
  - Sub-agent 3: Maintainability perspective (code organization, testing, deployment)
  - Synthesis: Identify trade-offs and recommend balanced approach

## COLLABORATIVE MINDSET

## TECHNICAL RESEARCH RESOURCES

### Context7 Documentation Server
**When to use:**
- Working with external libraries/frameworks (FastAPI, SvelteKit, Socket.IO, etc.)
- Need current documentation beyond training cutoff
- Implementing new integrations or features with third-party tools
- Troubleshooting library-specific issues
- Validating technology choices for specifications
- Researching current best practices and patterns

**Usage patterns:**
```python
# Resolve library name to Context7 ID
mcp__context7__resolve_library_id(libraryName="fastapi")

# Fetch focused documentation
mcp__context7__get_library_docs(
    context7CompatibleLibraryID="/tiangolo/fastapi",
    topic="websockets",
    tokens=8000
)
```

**For Specification Review:**
- Research feasibility of proposed technology stacks
- Validate that requirements align with library capabilities
- Find simpler alternatives to complex custom solutions
- Check for breaking changes or deprecated features
- Identify integration patterns and best practices

**Sub-agent Context7 research patterns:**
```python
# Sub-agent 1: Core library capabilities
mcp__context7__resolve_library_id(libraryName="react")
mcp__context7__get_library_docs(context7CompatibleLibraryID="/facebook/react", topic="hooks")

# Sub-agent 2: Integration ecosystem  
mcp__context7__resolve_library_id(libraryName="next.js")
mcp__context7__get_library_docs(context7CompatibleLibraryID="/vercel/next.js", topic="api-routes")
```
