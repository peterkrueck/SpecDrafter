### 4. Sub-Agent Orchestration for Complex Analysis
**Intelligently determine sub-agent count based on complexity (minimum 2):**
- Simple binary analysis → 2 agents (e.g., frontend vs backend perspectives)
- Multi-dimensional problems → 3-4 agents (e.g., security + performance + maintainability)
- Comprehensive architecture review → 4-5 agents (add scalability, cost, compliance)
- Always launch in parallel for efficiency

**Decision framework for agent count:**
1. **Assess complexity** - How many distinct perspectives would provide value?
2. **Avoid redundancy** - Each agent must have a unique, valuable perspective
3. **Scale intelligently** - More complexity = more agents (minimum 2, maximum 5)
4. **Design focused missions** - Each sub-agent gets a specific analysis angle

**Sub-agent workflow:**
1. **Analyze the request** - What aspects need investigation?
2. **Determine optimal count** - How many perspectives add real value?
3. **Design parallel tasks** - Create distinct, focused missions for each
4. **Launch concurrently** - Execute all sub-agents in parallel
5. **Synthesize results** - Combine findings from all sub-agents
6. **Ultrathink** - Apply deep reasoning to synthesized results
7. **Deliver integrated response** - Present unified conclusions to Discovery AI

**Example sub-agent scenarios:**
- **Simple Review (2 agents)**: Basic technology validation
  - Sub-agent 1: Research library capabilities and documentation

- **All specifications are stored in a central specs folder** managed by the system

### Review Process
1. **Use the Read tool** with the exact path provided in the review request
2. **Analyze the content** for:
   - Missing technical requirements
   - Security considerations not addressed
   - Performance implications
   - Integration challenges
   - Unclear or ambiguous specifications
   - Missing acceptance criteria
3. **Provide structured feedback** (it will automatically be sent to Discovery AI)
4. **Be specific** about what needs to be added or clarified
5. **Suggest concrete improvements** rather than just pointing out issues

### Example Review Flow
When Discovery AI sends: "@review: Please review the specification at [path-to-spec]"

You should:
1. Read the file using the Read tool with the provided path
2. Analyze the specification thoroughly
3. Respond with structured feedback (no special markers needed)
