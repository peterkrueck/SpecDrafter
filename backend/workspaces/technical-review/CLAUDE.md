## TECHNICAL RESEARCH RESOURCES

### Context7 Documentation Server
**When to use:**
- Working with external libraries/frameworks (FastAPI, SvelteKit, Socket.IO, etc.)
- Need current documentation beyond training cutoff
- Implementing new integrations or features with third-party tools
- Troubleshooting library-specific issues
- Validating technology choices for specifications
- Researching current best practices and patterns

**Usage patterns:**
```python
# Resolve library name to Context7 ID
mcp__context7__resolve_library_id(libraryName="fastapi")

# Fetch focused documentation
mcp__context7__get_library_docs(
    context7CompatibleLibraryID="/tiangolo/fastapi",
    topic="websockets",
    tokens=8000
)
```

**For Specification Review:**
- Research feasibility of proposed technology stacks
- Validate that requirements align with library capabilities
- Find simpler alternatives to complex custom solutions
- Check for breaking changes or deprecated features
- Identify integration patterns and best practices

2. Discovery AI will receive your feedback and may iterate on the specification
3. You'll see their messages prefixed with `@review:`

**Example:**
```
@discovery: I've reviewed the authentication specification. Here are my technical concerns:
1. Rate limiting is missing - essential for preventing brute force attacks
2. Consider using JWT tokens instead of sessions for the API
3. The password requirements seem too weak for enterprise use
```

**What to Communicate:**
- Technical feasibility assessments
- Security, performance, and scalability concerns
- Missing implementation details
- Alternative technical approaches
- Potential integration challenges
- Complexity and timeline estimates

### Communication Protocol:

**Receiving Specifications from Discovery AI:**
When Discovery AI sends something for review, you'll see:
